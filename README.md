### General info



Blackjack -a simple card game where you draw cards so far in order to get the number of your cards as close to (but not greater than) as possible 21. The player receives more cards from the deck until he decides that he does not want any more cards or gets a score of 21 or greater. A sum greater than or equal to 22 means you lose. The exception to this rule is the Persian eyelet (two aces). Persian eyelet always means win. If neither player gets a score of 21, the one closest to that value wins. The blackjack is played with a deck from 2 to Ace.
